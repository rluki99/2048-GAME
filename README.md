# 2048 GAME

2048 Game Rules

The objective of the game is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them and create a tile with the number 2048. Here are the specific rules:

#	The game is played on a 4x4 grid.
#	Each turn, a new tile will randomly appear in an empty spot on the board with a value of either 2 or 4.
#	You can move tiles in four directions: up, down, left, and right. When you make a move, all tiles on the board slide as far as possible in that direction until they reach the edge of the board or collide with another tile.
#	When two tiles with the same number collide, they merge into a new tile with the sum of their values. For example, if you slide two tiles with the number 2 together, they will merge into a single tile with the number 4.
#	The game ends when you either reach 2048 by merging tiles, or when there are no more possible moves.

Good luck and have fun!
